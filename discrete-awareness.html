		<h1 style="margin-top: 30px;">Discrete Awareness</h1>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">The ability to convey a message without shoving it into the player’s brain is a very tactical method that is used in the Fallout series. Discrete secondary meanings to scenarios create an environment where a player has the option to enjoy the game for it’s base gameplay, or they can look further into the messages and understand a deeper meaning behind the presented information. The second individual in this case is aware of the discrete meanings being hidden and is actively looking out for them. Once an individual playing these games becomes aware of the discrete societal and political topics that are being pushed, it becomes clear that each and every action in the game boils down to furthering these points. As an example, in the latest Fallout games there are different communities, some of which are meant to be seen by most players as good, however that is always subjective. There are also communities that are meant to be seen by most players as bad. In some specific cases if a player were to gain reputation with the “bad” community they would start to lose reputation with the “good” community until they reach a point of no return called vilification. This scenario looks to just be a key part of making decisions in a game, however it from the start is making the player pick a side and agree with their ways. Another example of an action that is discretely conveying a message to the player is the subtle racism that is directed towards humans from ghouls by calling them “smoothskins” in a derogatory tone. Anybody can clearly pick up on this being a form of racism, but when most people have never seen it displayed this way the game somewhat hides it in plain sight. Awareness gives meaning to otherwise meaningless scenarios, it allows the game to live on beyond the lifecycle of a typical game by instilling vices and virtues into a player. </p>
