		<h1 style="margin-top: 30px;">The Impact of Fallout</h1>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">	The Fallout series is an example of a collection of games that depend on a player to traverse a land of choices, and whether intentionally or not these choices are constantly bringing to light more issues that are visible in our own world. One impact of the Fallout series is that bringing in discretely the issues that are present in our own world sets the game closer to reality than a player might initially be expecting. The comparison of our world to the Fallout world is one that overlaps in almost all aspects of political and social issues. The reason this has an impact on our world in particular is because it shows a bleak reality of what is to come if nothing politically or socially changes soon. Nuclear warfare was the cause of the setting of this game, and the reality is that nuclear warfare is only seconds away at any point in time and there’s nearly nothing the common person can do about it. Bringing awareness to this issue is something that can slowly gain traction in growing an understanding of this reality and creating a change. The impact of the Fallout series on our world isn’t large, but it is more than nothing and making people aware of the similarities of our world and this fictitious world is at the very least leaving some sort of lasting impression on the minds of the players. </p>
